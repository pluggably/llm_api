- should be able to name sessions
- should track dates of prompts/commands/messages

front end:
- settings pane: add a button to test connection to the API
- add model functionality needed
- profile page doesn't have inputs for API keys for commercial products
  - we should also support credentials for commercial products if there are others ways to connect besides an api key
- sessions not working:
  - failed to load sessions: typeerror: instance of 'JsonMap': type '_JsonMap' is not a subtype of type 'List<dynamic>'
